            <p>To become a junior full stack developer, I joined Generation USA in April 2022. It was 16 weeks training. I have learnt about a web developing fundamentals and programming with Multiple Languages. During my Learning, I participated in multiple Coding challenges as a part of the program. I find this training is life-changing and it's great for me to set my career into the IT industry.

            <h2>Work experience
            </h2>
            <p>I worked with peers in our final project during learning code, Our instructor assigned a project which had 11 tasks and it was divided into 4 sprints with demo and retrospective at the end following with the scrum methodology.  It's my big opportunity to learn more. I find more ways to get/ give support to each other is essential. Now, creating websites looks deceptively easy, coders are anti-social, Coding is like composing a symphony. I would have guessed it was more like painting.</p>
